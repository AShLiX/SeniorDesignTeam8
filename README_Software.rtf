\f0\fs26 \cf0 We implemented drone simulations in jMAVSim, providing a realistic virtual environment for testing and validating flight dynamics, control algorithms, and overall system performance before deployment in real-world scenarios. Deployed Mavlink C++ library to enable efficient communication, streamlined control, and real-time telemetry data transmission. Integrated PixyCam2 C++ library and data structures, enabling robust object tracking capabilities through fast and accurate image processing. Developed a guidance system that utilizes tracking results from PixyCam2 to provide the drone with directions for movement, enabling navigation in response to the detected objects and their positions\
